# Advent of Code - 2020

### How to run

**Input**

- All files read input from .txt files in a hardcoded folder name of 'input'.
- Each input is labeled as 'Day#.txt'. For example, Day 23 would have an input .txt filename of 'Day23.txt'.
- All input files can be downloaded from the Advent of Code website found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020). 

**Code**
- For any given day, simply run the main method of the respectively named .java file.
- For ease, please use an IDE to run. Since this isn't really production stuff, I plan on keeping it simple and
presenting it mostly for code viewing purposes.
